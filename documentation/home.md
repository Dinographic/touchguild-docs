#### TouchGuild brings you closer to the Guilded API and comes with:

* Simpler names for events such as 'messageCreate' and not 'TeamMessageCreated' like Guilded does.
* Easy & predictable types which makes everything's easier to understand
* Methods, properties to help you be more productive.
* Strongly typed Client event emitter which allows you to don't 'read docs' when you need a specific 'event' or property of a component.
* Wisely chosen method names, named to be accurate to what they're actually doing.
* Those are some of the advantages by using TouchGuild as a Guilded library.
* Get raw data that directly comes from the Guilded API with Non-REST methods
* Communicate with the Guilded API with TouchGuild's DevTools, improving the library's durability and let you some time before switching to another library (if deprecation happen).

and even, more..
