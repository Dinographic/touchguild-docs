TouchGuild brings you closer to the Guilded API and comes with:

* Simpler names for events such as 'messageCreate' and not 'TeamMessageCreated' like Guilded does.
* Easy & predictable types which makes everything's easier to understand
* Strongly typed Client event emitter which allows you to don't 'read docs' when you need a specific 'event' or parameters of the component.
* Simple types, no weird types, just common sense.
* Types are inspired from Discord Eris Library, which makes Eris users an advantage to port their discord bot on Guilded.
