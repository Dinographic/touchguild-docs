#### Since TouchGuild is an early access library, we can't provide everything you'd like to get. We're doing our best to release helpful articles & documentation, such as this one.

You can make pull requests and participate to its development, and that's what we want, after all. A library powered by you, the community. Guilded API is still in early access and things can evolve faster. We're making our possible to stay up to date.
