<summary>Why is TouchGuild in early access?</summary>

TouchGuild is deploying slowly, we tested every methods, events.. but we're sure there is hidden bugs. It's up to you to tell us the bugs, as you use the library!

[If you find a bug, make sure to report it by clicking here.](https://github.com/DinographicPixels/TouchGuild/issues)

When we'll see that the library is stable, we'll switch to a 'B.E.T.A' branch since the Guilded API is still in early access.
