# ðŸ‘€ Our vision

## A library made by you, for you.

### Pull requests

We wanted to make a library where every bot developers collaborate to the project. By choosing the community, you, we're making what you like the most.

[Get started by making pull requests.](https://github.com/DinographicPixels/TouchGuild/pulls)

### Feature requests & bug report

If you know you won't collaborate to your library, you can still request features, they're helpful and they're representative of what the community would like to get.

You can also report bugs, they can be very important. By reporting you're enabling everyone to get back features that doesn't work anymore, or just issues with properties.

[You can create issues here. (issues includes feature requests & bugs, and even more).](https://github.com/DinographicPixels/TouchGuild/issues)
