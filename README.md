## Development builds (Nightly)

Nightly builds are pre-release builds, they're having new features in real time. Once there's enough features, we're releasing them as a brand new 'stable build'.

## Install Nightly builds

You can get new features before the stable release.

### Install the latest Nightly build automatically:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="npm" %}
```bash
npm install touchguild@nightly
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="yarn" %}
```bash
yarn add touchguild@nightly
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="ppm" %}
```bash
pnpm add touchguild@nightly
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Install the latest Nightly build manually:

```bash
npm install dinographicpixels/touchguild#nightly
```

1. Run the command
2. Go to `node_modules/touchguild`
3. Run: `npm run build` inside the touchguild folder
4. &#x20;Now, it's ready.

You need to reproduce those steps everytime you update to a newer nightly build.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Be aware that Nightly builds aren't stable and can have still have major bugs. If you face issues, feel free to report it by creating an issue on TouchGuild's GitHub, please specify that you're using a Nightly build.
